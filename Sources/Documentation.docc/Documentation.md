## Overview

This package comes with extended CoreGraphics functionalities & platform independent Image wrapper: ``NativeImage``


## Getting Started

`GraphicsKit` uses [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) as its build tool. If you want to import in your own project, it's as simple as adding a `dependencies` clause to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Vaida12345/GraphicsKit.git", branch: "main")
]
```
and then adding the appropriate module to your target dependencies.

### Using Xcode Package support

You can add this framework as a dependency to your Xcode project by clicking File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency. The package is located at:
```
https://github.com/Vaida12345/GraphicsKit
```
