# NativeImage

This package includes:
- Extended functionalities on the CoreGraphics framework.
- `NativeImage`: Unified `UIImage` and `NSImage`.


## Getting Started

`NativeImage` uses [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) as its build tool. If you want to import in your own project, it's as simple as adding a `dependencies` clause to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Vaida12345/NativeImage.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```
and then adding the appropriate module to your target dependencies.

### Using Xcode Package support

You can add this framework as a dependency to your Xcode project by clicking File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency. The package is located at:
```
https://github.com/Vaida12345/NativeImage
```

## Documentation

This package uses [DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/) for documentation. [View on Github Pages](https://vaida12345.github.io/NativeImage/documentation/nativeimage/)
